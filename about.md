<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I'm a full-stack web developer living in Portland, OR. I have experience working with several different technology
stacks, and on teams of all sorts of sizes.</p>

<p>Outside of coding: climbing, guitar, and my rescue dog take up my free time.
I love to talk movies, books, television, and games.
Beyond that, I'm always down to learn about new subjects and interests.
</p>

<h2>Skills:</h2>

<p>
On all the teams I've worked, I've had the opportunity to learn and work on the full range of the stack. I've worked on front-end, back-end, devops, and a lot of the data side of things. Even though I may not know some of the finer trivia of a language or technology, I make sure to learn enough about the tool to understand the situations where it might best be applied.
