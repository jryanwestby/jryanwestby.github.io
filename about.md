<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I'm a full-stack web developer currently living in Portland, OR. I have experience working with several different technology 
stacks, and on teams of all sorts of sizes. I am currently seeking new opportunities, so feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear about your project!</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I'm into way more hobbies than time allows. 
I love to climb, ski, and backpack. 
I've recently found a love for guitar.
I love to talk movies, books, television, and games. 
Beyond that, I'm always down to learn about new subjects and interests.
</p>
