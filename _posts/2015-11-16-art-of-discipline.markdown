I thought I’d open up my blog with a bit about the skill of self-discipline. When I look back on my professional development, from high school to college to my working life, I’ve realized that my handle on discipline is the biggest contributing factor to my personal idea of success. I consider this an essential tool for completing both short term and long term goals, developing good habits, and removing bad habits and addictions. 

There’s a lot to say about the topic of discipline, so I’ll share the ever-helpful wiki from the subreddit /r/getdisciplined. There is a wealth of knowledge here, with methods, guides, articles, and free tools for gaining a sense of discipline:
